sartha lv.

Juvenal, in this satire, indulges his honest indignation against
Crispinus and his employer Domitian.

Aster describing some of the enormous crimes of Crispinus, the
poet makes a sudden transitiou to his extravagance end gluttony,
and thereby takes occasion to describe eridioulous consultation,
held by Domitian cvera turbot‚ which was too large to be con-
tained in uny dish, thot could be found. suerting delibera-

tion among the senators, it was proposed, thet the fish should be
cut in picces ond thus coohed ; but at last the opinion of the een·
atorMoutanus provailed, that it should be dressed whole, und that
a dish, lorge enough to contain it, should be made expressly for
the purpose of receiving it.

The coancii is then dismissed, end the Setire concludes with a
most severe censure on the emperor's cruelty and injustice to-
wards some of the best and most worthy of the Romans.
